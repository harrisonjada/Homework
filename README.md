THIS IMAGE INSPIRES ME FOR THIS COHOR BECAUSE IT IS SYNONMOUS TO HOW AM I EXERCISING A PART OF MY BRAIN THAT I NEVER HAVE BEFORE TO GET STRONGER AND ACCUMULATE THE SKILLS THAT I NEED IN ORDER TO SUCEED. PARTICIPATING IN CLASS AND DOING THE HOMEWORK GIVES MY BRAIN THE STRENGTH TO DO THINGS I THOUGHT WERE IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT IS EXCITING TO ME.
